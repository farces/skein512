# Skein512-512 in Go
See http://www.h2database.com/skein/ for the original implementation. Based on the Scala version, which is (most likely) optimized for size.<br>

```go
go get github.com/farces/skein512/skein
import "github.com/farces/skein512/skein"
```

## Warning
Untested (outside of the naive 0xFF case), do not use with the impression that it is complete or faultless. For educational use only.
